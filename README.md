This repo contains my solutions for https://adventofcode.com

So far, I'm only working on the year 2020, but the project is set up to support multiple years.

All solutions are executed as unit tests.  For each day's problem, there is a test class with a name like
`Day1Test` and within that are test cases named `part1` and `part2` that check the correct answers.  (I first
*obtain* the answers by running the test with a dummy value and seeing what actually gets produced, then
if the value is accepted by AOC I swap it into the test for later regression.)
